            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>I am a sophomore at the University of Michigan pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in Fine arts and a minor in Computer Science to become a graphic and UI/UX designer. I am interested combining the aethetic and the techical to create my unique form of art.<br>
            I was born in Seoul, South Korea, and moved to China at the age of ten. In China, I attended a Korean international school, a Chinese local school, and an American international school. Now, I am studying in the states, where more cultural diversity exists. Having spent more than half of my life in such a global environment, I have become much more receptive to new ideas and "distruptive" in the sense that I strive to think outside of the box. I am confident that my international background can contribute positively to any community.</p>

            <h2>WORK</h2>
            <p>As a visual artist, I love to experiment with a wide range of mediums. Some of my favorites include color pencils, pen, watercolor, and acrylic paint. While I had created mostly two-dimensional pieces until my freshman year at college, I have been playing extensively with three-dimensional materials since this summer. I am planning to take elective studio courses such as Intro to Sculpture and Intro to Ceramics next semester, so that I can continue to develop interest and skills in this area.<br>
            As an aspiring graphic and UI/UX designer, I have also been working on digital platforms. Taking Typography has allowed me to refine my skills in Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop. I have also been building my programming skills in HTML, CSS, javascript, and python. To further develop my coding skills, I am planning to take Programming and Introductory Data Structures, a computer science course in C++, next semester.</p>
